# deep-reinforcement-learning-LunarLander
Implemented an autonomous landing of the LunarLander-v2, provided by OpenAI Gym, using a Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithm, TensorFlow, and Keras.
Given that the landerâ€™s various movements added score, the goal was to consistently achieve a successful landing while optimizing the score. My team and I, we trained the lander to reach the minimum score of 200 in 9 of the ten last tries.
